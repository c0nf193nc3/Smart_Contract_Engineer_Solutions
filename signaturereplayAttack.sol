/*

Explanation:

- The `SignatureReplayExploit` contract is designed to exploit the `ISignatureReplay` contract by potentially performing a reentrancy attack.

- It defines an immutable state variable `target` of type `ISignatureReplay` to store the address of the target contract that implements the `ISignatureReplay` interface.

- The constructor of `SignatureReplayExploit` takes an `_target` address as an argument and initializes the `target` variable with this address.

- The `receive` function is a fallback function that allows the contract to receive ether, but it doesn't contain any specific logic in this case.

- The `pwn` function is where the attack is potentially executed. It takes a `sig` parameter, which is expected to be a signature.

- Inside the `pwn` function, it calls the `withdraw` function of the `target` contract twice, each time with an amount of 1 ether and the provided `sig`. This repeated call to `withdraw` without proper reentrancy protection in the target contract can lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities.

It's important to note that reentrancy attacks are a serious security concern, and this code is provided for educational purposes. In practice, it's essential to design contracts with robust security measures to prevent reentrancy attacks and thoroughly test them for vulnerabilities.

Explanation of the code:

The "WETH" (Wrapped Ether) contract you provided is a Solidity smart contract that represents a wrapped version of Ether (ETH) on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract allows users to deposit ETH into the contract, mint an equivalent amount of wrapped tokens (WETH), and later withdraw their WETH to receive the original ETH. Below is a detailed explanation of the code:

1. The "WETH" contract inherits from the "ERC20" contract, which is a standard Ethereum contract template for creating fungible tokens. It specifies the token's name as "Wrapped Ether," symbol as "WETH," and has 18 decimal places.

2. The contract defines two events: "Deposit" and "Withdraw" to log deposit and withdrawal activities.

3. The contract includes a fallback function (`fallback() external payable`) that allows users to deposit ETH directly into the contract. When ETH is sent to the contract without specifying a function call, it calls the `deposit()` function to handle the deposit.

4. The `deposit()` function is used to deposit ETH into the contract and mint an equivalent amount of WETH tokens. It performs the following steps:
   - It mints WETH tokens for the sender by calling `_mint()` with the sender's address and the amount of ETH sent (`msg.value`).
   - It emits a "Deposit" event to log the deposit activity.

5. The `withdraw(uint _amount)` function allows users to withdraw WETH tokens and receive the equivalent amount of ETH. It performs the following steps:
   - It burns (destroys) the specified amount of WETH tokens from the sender's balance by calling `_burn()`.
   - It transfers the equivalent amount of ETH to the sender's address using `payable(msg.sender).transfer(_amount)`.
   - It emits a "Withdraw" event to log the withdrawal activity.

This contract acts as a bridge between ETH and WETH, allowing users to convert between the two by depositing and withdrawing tokens. WETH is often used in decentralized applications (DApps) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to facilitate trading and liquidity provision while maintaining the fungibility of ETH.
